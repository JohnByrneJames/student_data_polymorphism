# Polymorphism

#### A concept related to the object oriented approach of programming.

Polymorphism is one of the core concepts in OOP languages, it describes the concept that different classes
can be used with same interface. Each of these classes can provide its own implementation of the interface.
If a method sometimes referred to as an interface is overridden in another class
it is said to be polymorphic. This means it can be used to produce different results but through the same
method name.
